# Naviotech-Internship-Project-
I developed a credit card fraud detection system using Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders. The project handles imbalanced data and includes a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.
This includes my individual project kn credit card fraud detection.
